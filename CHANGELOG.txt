Changelog for pd-pulqui

v0.2.0, dated 29-10-2023

Now we scan which was the "highest value" that we have for the lap that "starts" whenever the sample exceeds a zero value and "stops" whenever the sample is smaller than a zero value. We write the highest value on all that lap. We do the same for the negative laps but we invert the lowest value.
